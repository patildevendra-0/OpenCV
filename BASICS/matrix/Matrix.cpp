//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
        
        The term "matrix" refers to a mathematical concept that involves a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. 

        Elements        : The individual values within a matrix are called elements. Each element is identified by its row and column position.

        Dimensions      : The dimensions of a matrix are given by the number of rows and columns it contains. For example, a matrix with m rows and n columns is said to have dimensions m × n.

                        a11 a12 a13.....n
                        a21 a22 a23
                        a31 a32 a33
                                .
                                .
                                n

                        a11     : is the element in the 1st row and 1st column.
                        a12     : is the element in the 1st row and 2nd column.
                        a13     : is the element in the 1st row and 3rd column.

                        a21     : is the element in the 2nd row and 1st column.
                        a22     : is the element in the 2nd row and 2nd column.
                        a23     : is the element in the 2nd row and 3rd column.

                        a31     : is the element in the 3rd row and 1st column.
                        a32     : is the element in the 3rd row and 2nd column.
                        a33     : is the element in the 3rd row and 3rd column.

        # Real scenario:
                            
                            | 2 5 7 |
                        A = | 3 1 4 |
                            | 6 8 9 |

                        Element :

                            Each value within the matrix is called an element. In matrix A, for example, the element in the first row and second column is 5. 
                            We denote this element as A12 
                            where a represents the matrix name, and the indices 1 and 2 represent the row and column positions, respectively.

                        Diamension  :

                            The dimensions of a matrix A are given by the number of rows and columns it contains. 
                            In this example, matrix A has 3 rows and 3 columns, so its dimensions are 3 × 3.
