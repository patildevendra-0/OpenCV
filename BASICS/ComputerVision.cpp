    Computer Vision:

                1)  Think of computer vision as the ability of a computer to see and understand the visual world, 
                    like how humans use their eyes and brains. It's like teaching computers to recognize objects, 
                    people's faces, and understand what's happening in pictures or videos. This helps machines make sense of the visual information they receive, 
                    allowing them to perform tasks like identifying animals, recognizing your friends in photos, or even helping self-driving cars "see" the road. 
                    In simple terms, computer vision is about making computers "see" and understand the world around them.

                2)  It involves the development of algorithms and systems that allow machines to gain a high-level understanding of images or videos.
                
            *   3)  The primary goal of computer vision is to teach computers how to extract meaningful information, make decisions, and perform tasks based on visual data. 
                    This field combines techniques from computer science, mathematics, machine learning, and image processing to enable machines to recognize patterns, identify objects, understand scenes, and even interpret human gestures.
